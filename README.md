--------------

**Grammar has two divisions:**

 - morphology (accidence) - how words are formed, how they change their form when used for different purposes
 - syntax - the use of words, how they are used in combination to form sentences

## Speech

Eight parts of speech: 

 - noun
 - pronoun
 - adjective
 - verb
 - adverb
 - conjunction
 - preposition
 - interjection

### Nouns

 - the name of a person, place or thing
 - types:
     - common nouns - indicates a class of persons, places or things
     - proper nouns - refers to an individual person or place
     - concrete thing - something that exists in physical form
     - abstract thing - something we can’t perceive with our senses
 - collective nouns

### Pronouns 

 - used in place of a noun
 - used to avoid repetition of nouns
 - types:
     - personal: you, I, me, he, she, him, her
     - possessive: your, yours, mine, his, hers
     - demonstrative: these, this, that
     - relative: whose, who, which
     - interrogative: what, who, which
     - indefinite: something, someone, anything, anyone
     - reflexive: myself
     - reciprocal: each other
 - alternative types:
     - subject: I, you, he, she, it, we, they
     - object: me, you, him, her, it, us, them
     - possessive: my, your, his, her, its, our, their, mine, yours, hers, ours, theirs
     - relative: that, which, who, whom

### Adjectives

 - modify nouns by giving information about them
 - descriptive, classifying
 - [descriptive adjective] [classifying adjective] [noun]
 - don't need a comma between them if they are of different types, do if they are of the same type
 - order: [opinion]-[size]-[age]-[shape]-[colour]-[origin]-[material]-[purpose]
 - types:
     - adjectives of quality - good, bad
     - adjectives of quantity - any, few, many
     - adjectives of number - one, infinite
     - demonstrative adjectives - this, that
     - possessive adjectives - my, your, his, her, its
 - degrees:
     - positive adjectives - (nice, good)
     - comparatives - more of (nicer, better)
     - superlatives - most of (nicest, best)

### Verbs

 - doing word, expressing an action or state
 - tenses:
     - past
     - present
     - future
 - present participle, often ends with -ing
 - past participle, often ends with -ed, -t, -n
 - auxiliary verbs:
     - help form verbs 
     - do, am, have
 - voices:
     - active voice - when the subject of the sentence is doing whatever is being done
     - passive voice - when the subject is not doing the action, but experiencing it
     - “I learn” vs “We are being taught”
 - moods:
     - what the verb is being used for
     - indicative mood - making a statement or asking a question
     - imperative mood - commands
     - subjunctive mood - used to express a doubt, uncertainty, order, recommendation, condition, purpose
     - infinitive mood - express an action or state without indicating the subject
 - non-finite parts
     - verb parts that cannot be connected with a subject, they cannot have a noun placed in front as a subject
     - the infinitive - names an action or state without reference to a subject
     - the participle - a verb that also does the job of an adjective
     - the gerund - a verb ending in '-ing' that acts as a noun (“swimming”, "smoking”)
 
### Adverbs

 - modify verbs, adjectives or adverbs 
 - describe how, when, where, etc
 - often end in -ly
 - place it as near to the word it modifies as possible
 - some adverbs qualify entire sentences/clauses - “probably”, “actually”, “surprisingly”
 - Adverb categories:
      - degree (I entirely agree)
           - emphasising (really)
           - intensifying (immensely)
           - moderating (rather)
           - focusing (only)
      - place (“here”, “there”)
      - time (“now”, “today”)
      - manner (“quickly”, “easily”)
 
### Conjunctions

 - linking words between clauses
 - coordinating conjunctions:
    - and/but/for/nor/or/yet/so 
    - link two clauses of equal status
 - subordinating conjunctions:
    - because/whether/unless 
    - link a main clause with a subordinate clause
 - after, although, if, before, as, since, than, though
 - correlative conjunctions - "both ... and ..."; "either ... or ...";
 - OK to start a sentence with one
 
### Prepositions

 - at, for, in, after, between, to, among, because of
 - show a relationship between words
 - generally placed in front of a noun/pronoun
 - take an object - "to the office", "in the net"

### Interjections

 - An exclamation
 - Expresses a feeling of the author or speaker

### Sentences

 - A group of words expressing a complete statement, wish, command or question
 - End in a full stop, exclamation mark or question mark 

### Clause

 - a group of words that contain a verb and its subject
 - a subordinate/subsidiary/dependent clause forms part of a sentence but can't make up a sentence on its own

### Phrase

 - a group of words that do not contain a verb

### Word order in a sentence

 - subject-verb-object 
      - (who did what to whom)
      - "she loves you"
 - subject - who or what the sentence is about
 - predicate - the rest of the sentence, apart from the subject

###Determiners 

 - determine the noun
 - a (indefinite article - "a dog")
 - the (definite article - "the dog")
 - any, each, every, some, this, that

### Subjunctive

 - verb form
 - indicate something is demanded or proposed
 - "I insist that you sit down"; "if I were you"
 - were/was, who/whom

### Relative clauses

 - restrictive/defining relative clauses - not enclosed by commas
 - non-restrictive/defining relative clauses (non-essential information) - are enclosed by commas
 - use which (and a comma) before defining non-restrictive clauses
 - use that (and no comma) before defining restrictive clauses
 - "should advertising, which targets children, be banned?"
 - "should advertising that targets children be banned?"

### Dangling modifiers

 - don't leave participles (/subordinate clauses) too far from their pronoun - reword instead
 - "having ...., they ...."

## Punctuation

### Apostrophes

 - to indicate missing letters - I'd, won't, it's
 - to indicate possessive (association or relationship) - dad's, people's
 - not for for every possessive - its, ours, yours, theirs
 - if the word ends with an s, to make it possessive add 's if that's how it's pronounced: "James's book", "waiters' tips"
 - to indicate time/quantity - "two days' time", "12 years' jail" - where the time period modifies a noun. Don't use when it modifies an adjective: "3 weeks old"

### Apostrophe examples:

 - He is staying with Jones
 - He is staying at Jones's
 - He is staying with the Joneses
 - He is staying at the Joneses'
 
### Commas

 - use where there's a natural pause in a sentence
 - use a comma if you could use 'and' to separate adjectives in a statement: "bright red car"; "tall, dark, handsome stranger"
 - use for a non-restrictive clause - when the words make a separate clause within the clause, and could be left out without changing the overall meaning (i.e. where they perform the same function as brackets)
 - don’t use in a restrictive clause - when the information is vital to the clause

### Oxford commas

 - "bacon, egg and chips"
 - "cereal, toast and marmalade, and a muffin"

### Colons and semicolons

 - use a colon where the first part introduces a proposition that is resolved by the second
 - use a semicolon between two related statements when a colon is too much and a comma is too little
 - use a colon to indicate the start of a list, and a semicolons in between 
 
### Brackets

 - use to clarify or give further information
 - punctuation stays outside brackets if the sentence content is complete without the extra content
 - dashes can be used in place of brackets or commas

### Hyphens

 - useful to avoid ambiguity: "black-cab driver"; "man-eating squid"; "don't panic-buy petrol"

### Paragraphs

 - make paragraphs the unit of composition - one to each topic
 - begin a paragraph with a topic sentence; end it in conformity with the start

### Active/passive

 - Use the active voice, where possible
 - more direct, bold, lively, emphatic

### Split infinitives

 - are OK.
 - use of adverbs between ... words.
 - "to boldly go", "to personally guarantee", "to aggressively avoid"

### Double-negatives

 - don't make a positive, except in maths

### Between/among

 - between when the relationship is reciprocal
 - among when it's collective relationships

### You and me/I

 - "between you and me" - when part of the object
 - "between you and I" - when part of the subject
 - "My friend and I would like a sandwich"
 - "Do you have any sandwiches for my friend and me"

### Compare to/with

 - to - liken
 - with - make a comparison

### Self

 - myself, yourself, himself, herself, ourselves, itself, themselves
 - emphatic - put the focus on a participant in a statement: "I myself..."
 - reflexive - reflects a relationship between one element and another: "she gave herself..."
 - I not myself when it's the subject: "myself had a drink"
 - me not myself when it's the object: "a drink for you and myself"

### Like

 - OK as a preposition: "ride like the wind"
 - Not OK as a conjunction with a clause containing a verb: "ride like you're riding a motorbike" - use "as if" instead 
 - Also use "such as" where possible

### i before e

 - deign, feign, heir, species, weird, seize

### Abbreviations

 - acronyms - Nato, laser
 - initialisms - pm
 - contractions - dr
 - shortenings - phone, tv
 
### Tips

 - never use a long word where a short word will do
 - If you can cut words out, do
 - keep statements in the positive form
 - place the emphatic words in a sentence at the end
